# Exploring Demographic Disparities in Crime Victimization

In this project, we use crime data from the city of Chicago to analyze the demographic characteristics of crimes across the 79 "zones" of the Chicago Area. Specifically, we examine health outcomes (such as Birth Rate, Infant Mortality Rate, Prevalence of Diabetes and Stroke, Breast Cancer, and etc), neighborhood data, income levels, education levels, and familial situation to see if certain groups are more likely to be victims of violent crimes (Assault, Homicide, Criminal Sexual Assault). My hope is that, by identifying these disparities, we can help guide policy-making to address these issues and promote greater equity in our communities. Our analysis includes visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, heatmaps, chloropleth maps, etc to help us better understand the patterns in the data. Through this project, we aim to shed light on the relationship between demographic characteristics and crime victimization and contribute to the broader conversation on social justice and public safety. 

Inference:

Some neighborhoods are at a higher risk of homicide and other violent crimes. Based on this data, it seems that there are notable disparities in crime rates across different neighborhoods, with some areas experiencing significantly higher rates of crime victimization. This could be attributed to various factors, such as socioeconomic status, population density, education levels, and availability of resources, all of which can influence crime rates in a given area. There also seems to be a clear correlation between poor health outcomes, poor social outcomes (such as lack of public housing, lower education levels), and violent crimes. Interestingly, crimes in Chicago also seem to exhibit seasonal patterns. Generally, crimes such as theft, robbery, and assault tend to increase during warmer months and decrease during colder months. There are a few potential reasons for this pattern: Weather, School schedules, Seasonal changes in employment opportunities. However, it is important to note that not all types of crime exhibit a strong seasonal pattern

While this is an honest attempt at understanding the crime data publically available on the Chicago Data Portal, this is in no way comprehensive, further research and investigation are needed to identify specific contributing factors and potential solutions for addressing these disparities, ultimately aiming to create safer environments for all community members.
